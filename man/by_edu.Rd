\title{Generate Bar Chart of Means by Education Level}
\usage{
by_edu(
  data,
  var1,
  var2,
  thevarlabs,
  thelabel = "<- 1: never     -     7: very often ->"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with survey data. Must include an \code{oplcat} (education category) column.}

\item{var1}{The starting variable name (unquoted).}

\item{var2}{The ending variable name (unquoted).}

\item{thevarlabs}{A character vector of labels for the variables.}

\item{thelabel}{A character string for the y-axis label.
Defaults to "<- 1: never     -     7: very often ->".}
}
\value{
A \code{highchart} object.
}
\description{
This function creates a grouped bar chart illustrating the means
of specified variables, categorized by education level (\code{oplcat}).
Error bars (standard errors) are included.
}
\details{
Steps:
1. Maps variable names to \code{thevarlabs}.
2. Processes \code{oplcat}: removes NAs, converts to labels (using \code{sjmisc::to_label}).
(Commented code shows potential for renaming/reordering education levels).
3. Selects \code{var1:var2} and processed \code{oplcat}, then removes NAs.
4. Calculates mean, SE, and N for each variable, grouped by \code{oplcat}.
5. Joins variable labels and orders them based on global \code{theorder}.
6. Generates a grouped column chart using \code{highcharter}:
- Columns are means per education level within each variable.
- Error bars (mean +/- SE) are linked.
- Y-axis is 1-7.
- Legend for education levels is shown.
- Caption includes N and error bar details.

\examples{
# Assuming 'survey_data' has 'q1'-'q5', 'oplcat',
# and 'var_labels' for 'q1'-'q5'. `theorder` should exist.
# by_edu(survey_data, q1, q5, var_labels)

Dependencies: dplyr, tidyr, highcharter, forcats, sjmisc
              (Note: `std.error` function defined elsewhere; `theorder` global variable)
