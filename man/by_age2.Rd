\title{Generate Bar Chart of Means for Three Specific Variables by Age Groups}
\usage{
by_age2(
  data,
  var1,
  var2,
  var3,
  thevarlabs,
  thelabel = "<- 1: never     -     7: very often ->"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame. Must include \code{age_groups} and \code{var1}, \code{var2}, \code{var3}.}

\item{var1}{The first variable name (unquoted).}

\item{var2}{The second variable name (unquoted).}

\item{var3}{The third variable name (unquoted).}

\item{thevarlabs}{A character vector of three labels for \code{var1}, \code{var2}, \code{var3}.}

\item{thelabel}{A character string for the y-axis label.
Defaults to "<- 1: never     -     7: very often ->".}
}
\value{
A \code{highchart} object.
}
\description{
Similar to \code{by_age}, but for three explicitly named variables
(\code{var1}, \code{var2}, \code{var3}). It creates a grouped bar chart of means
by age group, with error bars.
}
\details{
Steps:
1. Maps variable names (\code{var1}, \code{var2}, \code{var3}) to \code{thevarlabs}.
2. Selects \code{var1}, \code{var2}, \code{var3}, and \code{age_groups}, then removes NAs.
3. Calculates mean, SE, N for each of the three variables, grouped by \code{age_groups}.
4. Joins labels, orders variables by global \code{theorder}.
5. Generates a \code{highcharter} grouped column chart (means per age group) with error bars.
Y-axis 1-7. Legend for age groups. Caption with N.
}
\examples{
# `theorder` should exist.
# by_age2(survey_data, q1, q2, q3, c("LQ1", "LQ2", "LQ3"))

Dependencies: dplyr, tidyr, highcharter, forcats
              (Note: `std.error` function defined elsewhere; `theorder` global variable)
