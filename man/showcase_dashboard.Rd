\title{Generate a showcase dashboard demonstrating all dashboardr features.}
\usage{
showcase_dashboard(directory = "showcase_dashboard")
}
\arguments{
\item{directory}{Character string. Directory where the dashboard files will be created.
Defaults to "showcase_dashboard". Quarto will render HTML to directory/docs/.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the dashboard_project object.
}
\description{
This function creates and renders a comprehensive showcase dashboard that
demonstrates the full breadth of the dashboardr package. It includes multiple
visualization types, tabset grouping, standalone charts, and various page layouts.
}
\details{
The showcase dashboard uses General Social Survey (GSS) data to demonstrate:
\itemize{
\item Multiple tabset groups (Demographics, Politics, Social Issues)
\item Stacked bar charts with custom styling
\item Heatmaps with custom color palettes
\item Standalone charts without tabsets
\item Text-only pages with card layouts
\item Mixed content pages (text + visualizations)
\item Custom icons throughout
\item All advanced dashboard features
}

This dashboard is more comprehensive than the tutorial dashboard and showcases
the full power of dashboardr for creating complex, multi-page dashboards.
