Thank you for downloading and using dashboardr! We hope that you'll find it helpful and fun to use.

## How to use this package

Here's some information that you might find handy while you learn to use the package. This is a tutorial dashboard, which means that these pages were written by us, and are saved in the `dashboardr` R package. However, when you decide to call `create_dashboard()` using your own or sample data, an output directory will be generated.

## Locating your dashboard

Unless otherwise specified, your dashboard lives in the output directory! For example:

```
my_dashboard/
├── _quarto.yml
├── index.qmd
├── analysis.qmd
├── summary.qmd
└── about.qmd
```

## Editing your dashboard after rendering

You'll also have the option to create a new GitHub repository. `dashboardr` will tell you where it is saved upon rendering.

If you'd like to edit your pages further, you can do so by navigating to the output directory and editing the `.qmd` files manually. If that doesn't suit you, then you can also create visualizations with `create_viz() %>% add_viz()`, and build out the dashboard with `add_page()`.

For an example of a dashboard that demonstrates the full breadth of this package, check out the **[Showcase Dashboard](showcase_dashboard.qmd)** or click on the Showcase tab in the toolbar above. This tutorial dashboard demonstrates the `dashboardr` package using real examples from the vignettes.

## About this tutorial dashboard
