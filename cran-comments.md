  dashboardr is a framework for building static HTML dashboards from R.
  The package vignettes contain rendered HTML output with embedded
  interactive Highcharts visualizations, which are necessarily large.
  These pre-built vignettes are essential for users to understand the
  package's capabilities, as the output cannot be meaningfully demonstrated
  without the rendered HTML and JavaScript components.
